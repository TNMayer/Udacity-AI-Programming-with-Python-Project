Transformational AI: Analyzing Ecommerce Large Datasets for Machine Learning

Question 1: 
The DataFrame contains 100 Amazon Electronics reviews with columns: 
* rating (float - the star rating), 
* title (string - review title), 
* text (string - review body), 
* images (list - attached images), 
* asin (string - product ID), 
* parent_asin (string - parent product ID), 
* user_id (string - reviewer ID), 
* timestamp (integer - Unix time), 
* verified_purchase (boolean - if purchase was verified), 
* and helpful_vote (integer - helpfulness count). 

Each row represents one customer review with product identifiers, review content, images, and metadata.

Question 2: 
The output from .head() was somewhat expected in terms of the number of reviews but also surprising in terms of formatting. 
As expected, it displayed the first 5 rows of the DataFrame (indices 0-4). However, the 
plain text format made the output harder to read compared to the rich HTML table from 
before - the columns were split across multiple lines/blocks rather than displayed in a 
single row per record.

Question 3: 
We used pd.set_option() to customize how pandas displays the DataFrame output. Specifically:
1. 'display.max_columns' set to None - ensures all columns are shown without truncation.
2. 'display.width' set to 1000 - increases the width of the content which gets displayed in one row to 1000 characters.
3. 'display.max_colwidth' set to 50 - limits individual column content width in one column to 50 characters.

We also created a variable Items_To_Print set to 10, which was passed to .head(Items_To_Print) 
to display the first 10 rows instead of the default 5.

Question 4: 
The Reviews dataset and the Reviews Metadata dataset have different purposes and structures:

**Reviews Dataset** contains customer feedback with columns like:
- rating, title, text (review content)
- user_id, timestamp, verified_purchase, helpful_vote (user/review metadata)
- asin, parent_asin, images (product identifiers)

**Metadata Dataset** contains product information with columns like:
- title, description, features, price (product details)
- average_rating, rating_number (aggregated review statistics)
- main_category, categories, store (classification info)
- images, videos, details (media and specs)

The key difference of the two datasets is, that the Reviews dataset focuses on individual customer reviews and their associated metadata, 
while the Metadata dataset provides aggregated data on product-level (aggregated on product title level).

Question 5: 
I find the .info() method to be the most insightful and helpful data analysis method. It provides a 
comprehensive summary of the DataFrame in one output, including:
- The total number of entries (rows)
- Column names and their count
- Non-null counts for each column (helps identify missing data)
- Data types for each column
- Memory usage

While .columns gives just column names and .dtypes shows only data types, .info() combines this 
information and adds valuable context about data completeness.

Question 6: 
The histogram suggests a right-skewed distribution:
This means that the mean is greater than the median; the
most highly rated products cluster at lower price points, and frequency decreases as price increases. 
There are only a few higher-priced items, forming a long tail.

Question 7: 
The scatterplot shows no strong linear relationship between price and rating. 
Ratings stay clustered between about 4.5 and 5.0 across a wide range of prices, with only a few 
higher-priced outliers.
